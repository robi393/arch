Step 1
- Create a folder structure like this:

/img
  img1.jpg
  img2.jpg
bg.txt

File bg.txt:

  Introduction
  Diagnosting imaging has become a very important tool in medicine. It provides a way to map the anatomy of a patient which then can be used for diagnosis, treatment planning or medical studies. Medical imaging is used in various modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), digital mammography, ultrasound or computed tomography (CT). As technology evolves more and more medical images are being used in every day medicine and reliable methods and algorithms are needed to process the large amount of data aquired from the patients. These algorithms often provide a way to delineate regions of interests (anatomical structures, organs).
  
  Definitions
  "Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into distinctive regions (segments) with similar properties such as intensity, texture, brightness, and contrast." [x]
  
  Due to the fact that there are numerous image scans that need to be processed manual segmentation would take a long time and it would often leads to errors and this is why automated methods are needed to perform segmentation.

Moreover, due to the numerous image scans for each patient and similar intensity of the nearby organs, manual segmentation is a tedious task and is prone to errors. Therefore, reliable automated algorithms should be utilized to delineate the region of interest.
